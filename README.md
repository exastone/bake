# **bake** ðŸ¥§ - to help you bake C & C++ projects

## What is bake?
bake is a *make* wrapper and C/C++ build management tool.

## Why bake?

Simply put, GNU make is rather tedious to work with directly but very capable. The goal of bake is to bring a modern, user-friendly build system experience to C and C++ projects akin to what is offered by rust's ecosystem.

It's been my experience that C & C++ toolings is segmented and the burden is put on the developer to integrate the pieces to create a tolerable development experience. This process is monotonous and often a barrier for new comers. The goal of bake is to simpily the huddles of project creation and life-cycle build system management.

## What can bake do?

Current functionality of bake is limited to:
- Project initalization
- Auto-generating Makefiles for simple projects

A more comprehensive overview of usage will come after a proper CLI developed and the tool becomes practical for real use.
